Test implementation of Market Survey API
===========

Implementation of Market Survey , speficications taken from [UN/CEFACT](https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/cefact/brs/BRS_Market_Research_0.5.1.pdf)
with pure test purposes. Non production ready

## Symfony

App is based on symfony2 as a playground for DDD.

## Purpose

Small DDD project to show skills at architechture and delivering valuable products
 
[Symfony2](http://symfony.com/) provides a solid infrastructure to implement REST API

I decided not to use doctrine in order to make easier the implementation

Tests are mostly on infrastructure side, quite optimistic but fulfill the purpose for a test


## Test suite

use `docker` or run on host machine by `vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit`
